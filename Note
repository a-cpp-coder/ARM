hundreds of companies have licensed the ARM CPU, yeah, hard for RISC-V but need to make the courage moves

licensee must follow the 
- ARM CPU architecture
- Instruction set

but they are free to implement peripherals:
- I/O ports
- ADCs
- DACs
- Timers
- SPIs, I2Cs, UARTs

-> for the CPU, code is portable but not for the peripherals like I/Oports cause their:
- Special funtion registers
- Physical address locations to access the I/O ports
are not standardized and every licensee implements it differently 
(why there exist AUTOSAR compilant)

2 ways of approach:
- use the functions written by the vendor to access the peripherals 
  -> copyrighted, not portable

- access the peripheral's special function registers directly using C and   
  create your own library since you have total control over each function.
  Also these functions can be modified and used with another vendor
